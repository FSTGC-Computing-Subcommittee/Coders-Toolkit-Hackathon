                <h1>Scenario</h1>
                <p>
                    Sasha owns a restaurant called <i>Kruger Cuisine</i>, that's famous for its
                    high quality steak meals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The restaurant is open from Monday through Saturday from 8:00am to
                    8:00pm. The chefs and waiters work on shifts - a morning shift from
                    9:00am to 1:00pm and a night shift from 1:00pm to 8:00pm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a customer wishes to dine at the restaurant, they must call and
                    make a reservation or they will have to wait until either someone
                    misses their reservation or to wait for a free time slot after they
                    arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once they are seated, a waiter or waitress will give them a menu to
                    order from. They would then pay for what you ordered after receiving
                    their meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, with the onset of the pandemic, regular operations have
                    been disrupted.
                </p>
                <p class="emphasis">

                    solution for her?
