                <p> The restaurant is open from Monday through Saturday from 8:00am to 8:00pm. The chefs and waiters
                    work on shifts - a morning shift from 9:00am to 1:00pm and a night shift from 1:00pm to 8:00pm. If
                    you wish to dine at the restaurant, you must call and make a reservation or you will have to wait
                    until either someone misses their reservation or for a free time slot after you arrive. Once you are
                    seated, a waiter or waitress will give you a menu to order from. You pay for what you ordered after
                    your meal.</p>
