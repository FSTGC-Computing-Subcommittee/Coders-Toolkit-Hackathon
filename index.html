                <h1>Scenario</h1>
                <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Sasha owns a restaurant known as Kruger Cuisine, which is famous for its high-quality steak meals
                    and
                    excellent customer service, however, due to the onset of the pandemic, regular operations have been
                    severely
                    disrupted, primarily due to most of the business operations being offline.
                </p>
                <h3>Detailed Breakdown</h3>
                <p>
                    The restaurant is open from Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 12:00 am. The chefs and waiters
                    usually
                    work two shifts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A morning shift from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm</li>
                    <li>A night shift from 5:00 pm to 12:00 am</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, workers usually are notified of changes in their shifts before they clock out for the day
                    or via the
                    phone, which often leads to some being confused on what shift they should actually work on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, if a customer wishes to dine at the restaurant they would have to call to book their
                    reservation or
                    wait until a slot frees up due to someone missing their reservation or until someone's reservation
                    period has
                    ended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, due to most of the business operations being offline, customers would have to either call
                    the
                    restaurant or visit physically to know what meals are available on the menu for the week.
                </p>
